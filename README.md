Description: This desktop application is designed for managing graduation project topics. Its core functions include comprehensive data management, allowing users to add, update, and delete information related to both academic fields and the projects themselves. The application also provides robust listing and search capabilities, enabling users to view topics organized by field or supervising instructor, sort them alphabetically, and perform searches using keywords like project name or student ID. Finally, it offers statistical and reporting features to generate summaries, such as the number of projects per field or instructor, and to identify instructors who are supervising a minimum number of projects.
